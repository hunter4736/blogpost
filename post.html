              <span>Solar Snails are no longer just a myth.</span>
             
              <p>   Yes, you heard it here first folks, aliens have been discovered on the sun. These clever aliens who resemble the shape of large snails seem to be residing on the sun for solar nutrients. Scientist speculate that these Solar snails are the key to unlocking the secrets of the Universe. But the question remains are they peaceful, and do they have anything in common with the snails here? Upon further examination these solar snails share remarkable resemblance with the common water snail here on Earth. In order to find out more our team collected dozens of common water snails and attempted to communicate telepathically with them, however the outcome was unsuccessful. Our team decided the next wisest course of action was to get really high, thereby channeling a connection with the common water snails subconscious. After taking an unknown amount of LSD and hallucigenics mushrooms, as well as a small amount of crack cocaine I began to merge my consciousness with the common water snails. We danced in harmony on the moon, performing the ancient solar snail ritual. As this common water snail and I danced, communicating with each other soley through our dance moves I became aware of the past, present, and future of this common water snail. Her name was shirley and shes has lived a harsh and unforgiving life. But with several baby snail hatchlings along the way Shirley was forced to endure for the sake of her family. Humbled and in awe of Shirleys resilience, I gazed upon her with overwhelming affection. I lived as she did, saw what she saw, and felt what she felt and in this moment of deep connection I leaned in for a kiss. As my lips touched her slimy yet soothing skin I felt completely free. The moment was incredibly enchanting. But our kiss was inturrupted by an intense feeling of anxiety. My heart began to race and sweat began to perspire from my glands. My knees began to quake. As I struggled to understand what was happening Shirley assured me it was okay. We had completed the solar snail ritual, and what now appeared before us was the Solar Snail King. Trembling in his omnipotenece I muttured "who are you"? The Solar Snail replied in a thunderous voice that consumed the skies "I am." The power and energy he gave off forced me to my knees and to cover my face "I am not worthy" I cried out. The solar snail replied "arise my son, believe in yourself and you will find a greater strength than you could ever imagine." Suddenly I looked up and the Solar Snail King was gone, as was shirley. I was back on my bedroom floor laying there; I pondered what the solar king said to me. I vowed to protect Shirely, the common water snail whom I've just found from this point on and help her raise her young baby snail hatchlings. Together we can do anything!</p>
